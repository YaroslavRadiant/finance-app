# React Test Task

As a bonus, a display of changes in prices with colors and arrows has been added. Added possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group.
I also planned that it would be possible to go to the page of each individual ticker, on which there should have been graphs of price changes from the redux. This did not work due to the fact that when unmounting the component, I could not start the socket again with a new mount. How to solve this problem?

Also no tests, didn't write tests with redux before :(
